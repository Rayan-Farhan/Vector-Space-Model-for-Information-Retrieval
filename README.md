# Vector Space Model for Information Retrieval

This project implements a basic **Vector Space Model** for information retrieval using **TF-IDF** weighting and **cosine similarity** to rank documents based on a user's query. It includes preprocessing, index building, similarity computation, and a simple GUI for interaction.

## Features

- Custom preprocessing (tokenization, lowercasing, lemmatization, and stopwords removal)
- TF-IDF matrix generation
- Cosine similarity-based document ranking
- Threshold-based filtering of relevant documents
- GUI built with `tkinter` for running VSM queries interactively
